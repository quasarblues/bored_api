User's click the generate button to get ideas to cure their boredom. The related activity will be displayed as a card on the page. The information comes from the [Bored API](https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/).

The API called is made using a [CORS Proxy Server](https://corsproxy.io/).

**Note:** The Bored API and Proxy Server have very limited rates. If you click 'generate' and nothing appears it's because too many requests were made.
